LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION USING ML AND XAI

This project builds a machine learning–based system to predict loan approval using financial and demographic data.

Multiple ML models were evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the best performance across standard metrics.

Explainable AI techniques (SHAP, PDP, and Permutation Importance) were applied to interpret model decisions.

Key factors such as CIBIL score, loan term, and loan amount were identified, aligning with real-world lending logic.
