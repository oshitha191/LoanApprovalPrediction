LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION USING ML AND XAI

This project predicts loan approval using financial and demographic features.
EDA covers missing values, outliers, distributions, and correlations.
Preprocessing includes encoding, scaling, and balancing.
Seven ML models were trained and compared.
Random Forest achieved the best overall performance.
Evaluation used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC–AUC.
XAI methods (SHAP, PDP, Permutation Importance) explain model decisions.
CIBIL Score, Loan Term, and Loan Amount emerged as key predictors.
Insights align with real loan-approval logic.
The notebook includes full workflow, evaluation, and visual explanations.
